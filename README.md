ChronoPal isn't just an app - it's a VIBE! ✨ Imagine if the 90s had a baby with AI technology and dressed it in neon! That's us! A digital companion that's part nostalgia explosion, part cutting-edge tech wizardry!

## 🚀 Our Mind-Blowing Tech Stack 🚀

### 🎮 Frontend Magic ✨
- React 19 (so fresh it's practically from the future!)
- TypeScript (because we're fancy like that)
- Tailwind CSS (making things pretty without crying)
- React Router (helping you not get lost in our awesome app)
- Axios (fetching data like a pro digital pet fetches treats)
- Retro styling so rad it might give you flashbacks to your childhood!

### 🧠 Backend Sorcery 🔮
- FastAPI (zoom zoom - it's in the name!)
- MongoDB (where we store all your digital pet's deepest secrets)
- Python 3 (snakes are cool, and so is our code)
- OpenAI integration (your pet is actually kind of smart, who knew?)
- Authentication that's tighter than your favorite 80s jeans
- Testing with Pytest (because even cool code needs to behave)

## 🛠️ Wanna Make This Thing Run? 🛠️
