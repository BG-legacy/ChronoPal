# MongoDB Configuration for Vercel Serverless Functions

## The Challenge with MongoDB in Serverless

Vercel deploys your code as serverless functions, which creates challenges for MongoDB connections:

1. Serverless functions are ephemeral (they spin up and down frequently)
2. Creating a new MongoDB connection for each function invocation is expensive
3. Too many connections can exceed MongoDB connection limits
4. Cold starts can cause timeouts

## Our Solution

The code has been optimized for Vercel's serverless environment:

1. **Connection Pooling**: We've implemented optimized connection pooling settings specifically for serverless environments.
   - `maxPoolSize=10`: Limits the number of connections in the pool
   - `minPoolSize=0`: Allows all connections to close when idle
   - `maxIdleTimeMS=50000`: Closes idle connections after 50 seconds

2. **Connection Reuse**: We use a global variable pattern to reuse connections across function invocations within the same serverless instance.

3. **Quick Timeouts**: We've set aggressive timeouts to fail fast rather than hanging:
   - `serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000`: 5 seconds for server selection
   - `connectTimeoutMS=10000`: 10 seconds for connection attempts

4. **On-Demand Connection**: Connections are only created when needed through the get_mongo_client function.

## Session Management

Since Vercel's serverless functions don't maintain global state between invocations, consider:

1. Moving session storage to MongoDB instead of in-memory
2. Using short-lived tokens to authenticate users
3. Implementing stateless authentication where possible

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Connection errors in Vercel logs
- Slow response times that might indicate connection issues
- MongoDB Atlas metrics for connection counts

If you encounter persistent connection issues, consider adding additional optimizations or using a different database service like Vercel's Postgres or MongoDB Atlas's Data API.
